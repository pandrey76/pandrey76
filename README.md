- 👋 Hi, My name is Andrey.
- 👀 I’m interested in web technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Python.
- 💞️ I perfectly understand that I have a rather low level of qualifications in software development, so I have no one to cooperate with yet.
- 📫 If you have questions for me, you can ask them via mail pandrey76@yandex.ru.
